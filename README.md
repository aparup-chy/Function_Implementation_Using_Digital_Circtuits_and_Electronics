## This is a simulation based project on Digital Circtuits & Electronics
It is from one of my undergraduate courses titled Digital Circuits and Electronics which has the course initial as CSE251.
The simulation is done in LT Spice. It includes circuits like Differentiator, Intigrator and digital devices like diodes, OpAmps etc. A function is implemented with the combination of all of this materials.
